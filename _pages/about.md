# About me
I'm a third year undergraduate student from [School of Mathematical Sciences](https://math.sjtu.edu.cn/), [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/). My research interest includes causal structure learning, causal representation learning machine learning, causal NLP.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Lin Liu](https://linliu-stats.github.io/) and [Prof. Yu Guang Wang](https://yuguangwang.github.io/) from [School of Mathematical Sciences](https://math.sjtu.edu.cn/) and [Institute of Natural Sciences](https://ins.sjtu.edu.cn/), [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/). 

You can find my CV here: [Hao Chen's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/my_cv.pdf).
